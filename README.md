My name is Kevin Heleodoro. I am a US Army veteran who found a passion for programming. I am focused on developing my skills as a front end developer,
while also gaining an understanding of back end development. 

Currently, I am looking to build as many applications as I can to practice my programming skills and learn from those with more experience. 

Please feel free to leave comments or issues on any of my repos; I love any and all constructive feedback.

  frontend: [React, jQuery],
  backend: [Express, Node],
  database: [PostgreSQL, MySQL]
}
